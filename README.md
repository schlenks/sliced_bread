# Greatest Beverage

Congratulations! After years of tinkering with your secret recipe you have managed to create the world's greatest beverage. Inspired by some of the great modern day entrepreneurs, you have chosen to sell your beverage directly to consumers from your site. With an MVP perspective, you have chosen to ship a minimal set of features to start with the intention of improving the site based off of your customers' feedback.

## Phase 1

### Create a landing page that

- [ ] Tells the visitor what your drink is called
- [ ] Includes an image (or images) that has your drink in it.
- [ ] Describe the drink so everyone understands why it’s the greatest beverage ever.
- [ ] A privacy focused “pay me later” order form that contains the following:
- [ ] Customers name
- [ ] Quantity of drinks to purchase
- [ ] City
- [ ] State/Province
- [ ] Country
- [ ] An order button

### After ordering

- [ ] Confirmation that the order succeeded
- [ ] Provide order confirmation number
- [ ] Provide unique URL to see order confirmation & details

#### Phase 1 Notes

- Images can be your own or from the internet. A great site for public domain photos is [Unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com).
- "pay me later" means you are _not_ asking for any payment information.
- Customers name should be optional, if the visitor does not supply one you should make up a name for them
- Quantity of drinks to purchase should be optional, if the visitor does not supply an amount, you should decide the amount they are ordering
- City, State/Province and Country are required
- The order button can have any call to action text (button text) _except_ "Order" or "Submit".
- Keep your customers privacy in mind throughout the ordering process

## Guidelines

- This challenge is intended to take you a few hours of focused time.
- Think of your submission as being a code review request. Submit code that you would personally like to review.
- We will be reviewing it from the perspective of you being a member of the team.
- If there are steps that extend beyond what we have supplied in our sample templates, document them.
- Your PR description & loom video will be reviewed first and will be used to judge your submission. Include anything in there that you would like us to read. Decisions or tradeoffs that you made, document it.

### AI Tooling

In today's fast-paced world of AI and software engineering, tools like Cursor, Github CoPilot, and ChatGPT can be great companions to help boost your productivity. Feel free to use these tools during this technical assessment, but make sure you understand the code suggestions they provide.

### What we look for

When we are reviewing your Pull Request, these are the areas we will be focusing on:

- We care about code quality - Does it follow good coding practices & guidelines?
- We care about functionality - Does it do what it should do?
- We care about maintainability - Will this code be easy to maintain and build off of?
- We care about performance - Is it fast?
- We care about readability - Is it easy to understand?
- We care about testing - Is it well tested?
- We care about usability - Is it easy to use?

### Loom Submission

Loom Submission

As a remote company, great video communication is crucial for us. We value crisp Loom demos that showcase your personality and hankering for your work. Your submission should be under 5 minutes and include a very brief introduction of yourself, a walkthrough of your code, and the decisions you made while crafting your solution. If you used AI tooling, please highlight what tools you used, where you used them, and how they helped (or hindered) you. This video will help us understand your thought process and how you approach problem-solving in a remote environment.

### How to get started

We've created 5 shell applications that have been dockerized. These shell applications should provide you with a basic application that will allow you to get started really quickly.

If you prefer to do the Greatest Beverage challenge in a different language, we ask that you provide a solution that is dockerized and can be built and started with minimal steps.
